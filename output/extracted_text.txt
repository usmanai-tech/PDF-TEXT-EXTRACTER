SEVENTY-THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH
FIFTY-SEVEN CENTS ($473,600.57) as of May thirty-first (31%), two
thousand twenty two (2022), to the mortgagee of the Mortgage, with the
purpose of cancelling the obligation secured by the Mortgage, that such
payment in full of the amount of the indebtedness of the loan secured by the
Mortgage does not constitute an absolute guarantee of the cancellation of
the Mortgage in the Registry. The subscribing Notary also advises Buyer
that it has the right to require that such lien be cancelled concurrently with

Reduction Act of Nineteen Ninety Two (1992), as codified in forty two
United States Code Section four thousand eight hundred fifty one ef
sequitur (42 U.S.C. § 4851 et seq.) (hereinafter, the “Act”), I have advised
the appearing parties as follows: every purchaser of any interest in
residential real property on which a residential dwelling was built prior to
nineteen seventy eight (1978) is notified that such property may present
exposure to lead from lead-based paint that may place young children at risk
of developing lead poisoning. Lead poisoning in young children may
produce permanent neurological damage, including learning disabilities,
reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems and impaired memory.
Lead poisoning also poses a particular risk to pregnant women. The sellers
of any interest in residential real property is required to provide the buyers
with any information on lead-based paint hazards from risk assessments or
inspections in the seller’s possession and notify the buyer of any known
lead-based paint hazards. A risk assessment or inspection for possible leadbased paint hazard is recommended prior to purchase. To the extent that the
Act is applicable to the purchase and sale transaction consummated herein,
the Act imposes on the Sellers, its agents and realtors, if any, before the
Buyer are to be bound by a contract for the purchase and sale of residential
real property, the obligation to: (i) disclose its knowledge of the presence of
lead-based paint or any other known hazard in the Property related to leadbased paint; (ii) provide a ten (10) day period to allow the Buyer to inspect
the Property for possible lead-based paint hazards; and (iii) provide an
information booklet (“Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home”)
prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency. To the extent the Act is
applicable hereto, the Act requires that a document signed by the Buyer and
the Sellers acknowledging compliance with the abovementioned
requirements be attached to the purchase and sale contract. To the extent the
Act is applicable hereto, the Sellers and its agents should keep a copy of
said contract and its attachments (with the disclosures stated above) for a
period of not less than three (3) years. Non-compliance with the

requirements of the Act exposes the Sellers to possible liability. The Buyer

01038982 v1 9
hereby acknowledge that, to the extent the Act is applicable hereto, it has
been given the opportunity to inspect the Property and that it was informed
more than ten (10) days prior to the execution of this Deed of its right to
assess the risk of lead-based paint in the Property. The Buyer and the Sellers
acknowledge and accept that, to the extent the Act is applicable hereto, they:
(i) have complied with the requirements of the Act; (ii) have examined the
information related to the possibility of the presence of lead-based paint in
the Property; and (iii) certify that, to the best of their knowledge, all the
information they have provided in this paragraph is true and accurate. With
full knowledge of the contents of the present warning, the Buyer and the
Sellers proceed with the execution of this Deed as hereinafter provided. -----I, the undersigned Notary Public, do hereby certify that the appearing
parties hereto, after reading this Deed and understanding the scope and
meaning of the foregoing warnings and explanations to their satisfaction,

their initials on each and every page of the original of this Deed; and that
this Deed was executed by the appearing parties before me, the undersigned
Notary Public, after waiving their right to request the presence of witnesses,
of which right I apprised them. ------------------------------------------------------I further certify and attest that the appearing parties and I know and fully
understand the English language that I have reviewed the authority of the
Buyer and the same duly provide the authorities hereto and comply with
applicable law; and I further attest as to the appearing parties’ personal
qualifications. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------] further certify as to everything stated or contained herein. --------------
